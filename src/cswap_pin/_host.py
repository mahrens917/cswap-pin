"""Everything cswap-pin borrows from claude-swap, in one place.

The pin runs INSIDE claude-swap: it is loaded by `claude-swap[pin]`, reads the
account store cswap owns, and rewrites the config file cswap already rewrites.
So it needs part of cswap's internals — but "needs part of" is exactly the
coupling that made splitting the two hard in the first place, and an import
scattered across 2800 lines is a dependency nobody can see the shape of.

This module IS that shape. Eight symbols, eight modules, listed once:

    paths.get_global_config_path      where the env block lives
    paths.get_claude_config_home      the config dir root
    settings                          read/write the pin record
    exceptions.AccountNotFoundError   pin resolution failures
    exceptions.ConfigError            ...
    switcher.ClaudeAccountSwitcher    the account store
    switcher.switch_off_at_limit_account   walls the account a 429 just hit
    oauth                             token extraction and refresh
    usage_store                       Claude Code's usage requests: their
                                      forms and the store's serve/forward/
                                      hold answers (switcher decides them)
    claude_locks.claude_config_lock   serialize config rewrites
    pin                               cswap's identity readers over its own
                                      backup store, for set/show/re-pin
    printer                           accent, dimmed, warning: the CLI's styling
    start_hold                        the Remote Control start hold, released
                                      on the server's registration (X3768)

Two rules follow from putting it here:

1. **Nothing else in cswap_pin imports claude_swap directly.** A new import
   elsewhere grows the contract silently; a new name in this file is a
   deliberate change to it, visible in one diff.
2. **claude-swap is a PEER, not a dependency.** It is not in our
   ``dependencies``: cswap-pin is loaded by claude-swap, so declaring it here
   would make the pair circular and pull the whole switcher into anyone who
   installs cswap-pin alone. The import therefore has to be able to fail, and
   ``require()`` is where that failure gets a readable message instead of a
   traceback from line 2000 of the proxy.
